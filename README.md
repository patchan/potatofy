# potatofy

A Questrade integrated investment tool for easy portfolio rebalancing calculations in the passive investing spirit of the Canadian Couch Potato. Easily calculate how many shares of each holding to purchase/sell to achieve a target asset allocation.

Potatofy requires authentication through your Questrade account to retrieve your account balances, which is handled entirely in client. Potatofy currently only supports login through two-factor authentication (which you should be using anyway!).
